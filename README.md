# Simple Video Compressor for Discord UPDATED (2025)

This project is a fork of the original made by [Mightypotatotoast](https://github.com/Mightypotatoast/Video-Compressor-for-Discord).

Since Discord updated their upload limits (10mb for the free tier, 50mb for the Nitro Basic tier and 500mb for the Nitro tier) I decided to update the program. 

## Getting Started

Download [DiscordVideoCompressor.zip](https://github.com/nahuelranieri/Video-Compressor-for-Discord-UPDATED/releases)

Extract it anywhere.


## Usage

1. Run main.exe<br />
   ![launch dat .exe](/img/launch.png)

2. Choose your input video<br />
   ![browse dat file explorer](/img/browse.png)

3. chose your desired size, frame rate, and accuracy (slower is more accurate)<br />
   ![choose dat option .exe](/img/select.png)

4. Press "Go !" (the bigger the video the longer it will takes)<br />
   ![press dat button .exe](/img/go.png)
   <br />The result should pop in the same folder as the imput with the same name but ending with \_compressed.mp4
